# Changelog

Every commit adds its changes here, newest first, grouped by date.

## 2026-10-22

- Docs: README in English with an updated feature list and a link to the pr0game source on Codeberg; this changelog; `CLAUDE.md` with the repository rules.
- Add the MIT license.
- CI: after green tests on `main`, trigger the deployment via `repository_dispatch` (target repository and token are secrets) instead of deploying from this repository.
- Ingest API: drop the unused `url` field.
- Quick sync: series mode – after saving, "next page" reads the clipboard again.
- Mobile tab bar: my empire and activity instead of galaxy and spy reports.
- Mobile UI:
  - Top bar and bottom tab bar below 800 px; the sidebar becomes a flyout drawer behind "More".
  - Quick sync bottom sheet with paste from clipboard; the sync logic is shared with the sync page.
  - Galaxy browser: position cards instead of the wide table, swipe and a step bar to change systems, the system strip as a drag scrubber, collapsible phalanx list.
  - Touch fixes: tooltips as a sheet, larger menu targets, 16 px inputs, scrollable tabs and admin tables.
- Battle report crawler: backs off while the game is unreachable and pauses after `CRAWLER_GIVE_UP_HOURS`; the admin page shows the archive state and can resume the worker.
- Localization: web app in German and English, language per user; server errors carry stable codes. The galaxy freshness map moved to the bottom of the galaxy page.
- Live points on the empire page, overview deltas per statistics update, pirate language ("pi") of the SetSail theme, element costs for shield domes, special defenses and missiles.
